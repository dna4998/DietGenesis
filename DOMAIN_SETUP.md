## Domain Configuration Steps

### 1. Deploy Your App on Replit
1. In your Replit project, click the **"Deploy"** button (top right)
2. Choose **"Autoscale"** deployment for production
3. Wait for initial deployment to complete
4. You'll get a temporary `.replit.app` URL

### 2. Add Custom Domain
1. In your Replit Deployments dashboard, find your deployed app
2. Click **"Custom Domain"** or **"Domains"**
3. Click **"Add Domain"**
4. Enter your custom domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
5. Replit will provide DNS configuration instructions

### 3. Configure DNS (At Your Domain Registrar)
You'll need to add DNS records where you manage your domain:

**Option A: CNAME Record (Recommended)**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @ (or leave blank for root domain)
Value: [provided by Replit - something like: abc123.replit.app]
```

**Option B: A Record**
```
Type: A
Name: @ (or leave blank for root domain)
Value: [IP address provided by Replit]
```

### 4. SSL Certificate
- Replit automatically provides SSL certificates
- Your site will be secure: `https://yourdomain.com`

### 5. Verification
